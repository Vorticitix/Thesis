- Discuss if exit zones of high RWP activity coincide with Rossby wave breaking and may be regions with enhanced likelihood for extreme weather

- Consider GFS Histograms: Discuss hypothesis that GFS is able to forecast RWPs on long range forecasts but only if the RWP is already initialized


Writing results:
- Interesting: Despite low values for E errors are very large near the subtropics.
- Check: Is the reason why polar cp values are so low due to the fact that RWPs do not penetrate this areas?
- Try to find evidence about non-conservative dynamics of wind speed biases in GEFS
- Find main areas of rossby wave breaking
