- Phase speeds are slightly higher than zonal wind at 700 hpaover land while reverse is true over oceans
- Group speed is smaller than zonal wind at 300 hpa
- Significant correlation for RWPS between Europe and western North Pacific

- In Winter strongest zonal wind in subtropical jet. in summer more shifted towards the north and weaker
- In winter storm tracks are split over Asia. In summer it is much more symmetric
- Winter biggest phase speeds over Japan and Newfoundland. In summer largest values over Newfoundland and Himalayas

- Due to use of hindcasts no real changes in model performance over the years
