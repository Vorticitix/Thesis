- Phase speeds are slightly higher than zonal wind at 700 hpaover land while reverse is true over oceans
- Group speed is smaller than zonal wind at 300 hpa
- Significant correlation for RWPS between Europe and western North Pacific

- In Winter strongest zonal wind in subtropical jet. in summer more shifted towards the north and weaker
- In winter storm tracks are split over Asia. In summer it is much more symmetric
- Winter biggest phase speeds over Japan and Newfoundland. In summer largest values over Newfoundland and Himalayas

Predictability of the European heat and cold waves

- Due to use of hindcasts no real changes in model performance over the years
- NWP does better for cold extremes in winter than for hot extremes in summer
- Onset and end of temp extremes are harder to predict
- Heatwaves have shorter predictability than cold waves
- Predicitng temp extremes show significant benefits up till 14 days. Forecasts up to 7 days are defined as robust

Wulff & Domeisen 2019
Higher Subseasonal Predictability of Extreme Hot European Summer Temperatures as Compared to Average Summer

- ECMWF better at forecasting heatwaves than other models
- Predictability of warm near surface extremes is higher than for weather around the mean
- European summer warm extremes are better predicted than winter cold extremes for ECMWF. Especially for Russia.
- Very extreme and persistent events may increase predictability in a strong way

Identifying Key Driving Processes of Major Recent Heat Waves

- Circulation is a major contributor to major heatwaves in recent years.
