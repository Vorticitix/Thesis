In Table \ref{tab:GSS_average_Europe} we show the mean GSS for warm and cold extremes in all seasons by comparing the ERA5RF forecasts issued 5 days before the onset of an extreme event (D-5) with the ERA5 reanalysis. The GSS is computed for each event individually for each box in Fig. \textcolor{red}{(Link to Map Europe with Boxes!!!)}. Next, we compute the average GSS for all events in every season. Finally, we compute a weighted average for all grid boxes using the number of events, so we end up with one GSS value for cold and warm extremes in every season representing the predictability of persistent extremes in Central-Europe.

From Table \ref{tab:GSS_average_Europe}, we can see that predictability of cold and warm extremes is similar across the season with higher predictability in DJF and SON and slightly lower predictability in MAM. The exception here is JJA, where a notable difference can be seen. The highest GSS value are found during summer warm extremes indicating increased predictability for these events. On the contrary, the lowest GSS value is found for summer cold extremes indicating that these events are especially hard to forecast. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:GSS_Europe} we show the mean GSS for the whole European continent and its surroundings for warm and cold extremes in DJF and JJA. We do this by comparing every ERA5RF forecast issued 5 days (D-5) before the onset of an extreme event within a 4\degr x4 \degr grid box with the ERA5 reanalysis data and computing the GSS for every single forecast. We compute the mean GSS over all events for every grid box, and to smoothen the field for every grid box we compute the spatial average using the GSS values of the respective grid box, and its 8 adjacent neighboring grid boxes.

The lower GSS value that we found for JJA cold extremes in Table \ref{tab:GSS_average_Europe} is confirmed by Fig. \ref{fig:GSS_Europe}, where the average GSS values in Fig. \ref{fig:GSS_Europe}d are generally much lower than during cold extremes in DJF or warm extremes in general. Going into more detail, it can be seen that the GSS exhibits regional differences, where the extreme events have a different predictability in different regions. Broadly speaking, Northern European areas seem to be associated with extreme events that are better predictable compared to Southern European areas, but large regional differences within the aforementioned areas still remain. Especially notable are areas of low predictability over Iceland during warm extremes in DJF and the Western Mediterranean during cold extremes in DJF. On the contrary, Northern Russia and Eastern Scandinavia during warm extremes in DJF, The Arctic Ocean during cold extremes in DJF and Scandinavia during warm extremes in JJA stand out as areas with higher predictability. Especially, the latter area really stands out compared to other European areas during summer warm extremes, and this may also explain the higher value found for JJA warm extremes in Table \ref{tab:GSS_average_Europe}.
